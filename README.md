# Jackpet Agent – An Agentic, Chain-Agnostic On-Chain Game

## Intro
Jackpet Agent is a chain-agnostic, agentic on-chain pet game, deployed on Sepolia, where players grant a single ERC-7715 permission and let an autonomous agent auto-play multiple rounds with enforced limits via MetaMask Advanced Permissions.

> **Hackathon Notice:**  
> This project includes dedicated sections for **Advanced Permissions Usage** and **Social Media** as required by the MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off.

## Project Overview

**Jackpet Agent** is an agentic, chain-agnostic, luck-powered on-chain pet game built to showcase **MetaMask Advanced Permissions**. Currently deployed on **Sepolia** as a reference network, Jackpet Agent allows players to grant a **single ERC-7715 permission** and delegate gameplay to an autonomous agent that can automatically start and execute multiple game rounds on their behalf—without repeated wallet confirmations.

By combining adorable pet-themed gameplay, verifiable on-chain randomness, and permission-based automation, Jackpet Agent demonstrates how **Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715 + EIP-7702)** unlock seamless, trust-minimized autonomous gaming experiences.

## Why Jackpet Agent

Traditional on-chain games require users to manually approve every action, resulting in frequent wallet pop-ups and fragmented gameplay. Jackpet Agent reimagines this flow:

* ✅ One-time, limited permission via ERC-7715
* 🤖 Autonomous agent executes multiple game rounds
* 🔐 All actions strictly enforced on-chain
* 🔄 Permissions are revocable at any time

This makes Jackpet Agent a native example of an **agentic dApp** powered by Advanced Permissions.

---

## Core Gameplay

Players participate in a luck-based pet game by authorizing an agent to start games within clearly defined constraints.

* **Ticket Fee**: 0.01 ETH per game
* **Authorization Model**: Single ERC-7715 permission (spend + game-start)
* **Execution**: Autonomous agent triggers game rounds
* **Automation**: Multiple rounds executed without further user interaction

Each round randomly draws **12 pets** from a set of **24 pets**, composed of **3 types with 8 variations each**.

---

## Verifiable Randomness

All randomness in Jackpet Agent is powered by **Chainlink VRF**, ensuring that every game outcome is:

* Fully on-chain
* Tamper-proof
* Publicly auditable
* Provably fair

This guarantees that neither the agent nor the project team can influence game results.

---

## Prize Pool Mechanics

* **Initial Liquidity**: Bootstrapped by the project
* **Prize Pool Growth**: 1% of each losing ticket is automatically added to an on-chain prize pool
* **Custody**: Fully controlled by smart contracts
* **Team Access**: ❌ The project team cannot withdraw funds under any circumstances

---

## Reward Rules

Rewards are determined by the final pet combination drawn in each round. Each winning outcome consists of:

1. A **ticket-based payout multiplier**
2. A **percentage share of the current prize pool**

| Pet Combination | Ticket Multiplier | Prize Pool Share |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `{8,4,0}`       | 11×               | 99%              |
| `{8,3,1}`       | 6×                | 30%              |
| `{8,2,2}`       | 6×                | 30%              |
| `{7,5,0}`       | 6×                | 30%              |
| `{7,4,1}`       | 4×                | 10%              |
| `{7,3,2}`       | 2×                | 10%              |
| `{6,6,0}`       | 6×                | 30%              |
| `{6,5,1}`       | 2×                | 10%              |
| `{6,4,2}`       | 1.1×              | 0%               |
| `{6,3,3}`       | 1.2×              | 0%               |
| `{5,5,2}`       | 1.2×              | 0%               |
| `{4,4,4}`       | 1.1×              | 0%               |
| `{5,4,3}`       | 0×                | Loss             |

## Jackpot Highlight

The legendary combination **`{8,4,0}`** represents the ultimate jackpot.

* 🎉 **11× ticket payout** (excluding original stake)
* 🏆 **99% of the entire prize pool**

This rare outcome creates a highly memorable, fully verifiable on-chain jackpot moment—executed autonomously by the agent.

---

## Advanced Permissions Design

Jackpet Agent uses **MetaMask Advanced Permissions** as a core primitive:

* **Standard**: ERC-7715
* **Execution Layer**: EIP-7702
* **Scope**: Limited ETH spend + game-start calls
* **Constraints**: Per-round cost, max rounds, validity period

All permissions are:

* Enforced on-chain
* Transparent to users
* Revocable at any time

---

## Social Commitment

Jackpet Agent is designed with long-term responsibility in mind:

* 🔒 Prize pool funds are locked by smart contracts
* ❤️ **20% of the contract’s annual balance** is committed to charitable donations

Automation does not compromise accountability—every action remains verifiable and governed by code.

---

## Vision

Jackpet Agent aims to demonstrate the future of autonomous on-chain applications:

* 🤖 Agent-driven gameplay with strict permission boundaries
* 🔐 Trust-minimized automation using Advanced Permissions
* 🎲 Provably fair randomness
* 🧩 Chain-agnostic architecture for EIP-7702–enabled networks
* 🌍 A blueprint for agentic games and autonomous dApps

---

## Hackathon Context
Jackpet Agent is a **new project built specifically for the MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off**. While inspired by the original Jackpet game mechanics, the project has been re-architected from the ground up to highlight **ERC-7715 permissions, agent-based execution, and autonomous gameplay**.

It serves as a concrete example of how Advanced Permissions unlock seamless, secure, and creative agentic user experiences.

## ⭐ Advanced Permissions Usage
Jackpet Agent is built explicitly around **MetaMask Advanced Permissions**, using a single ERC-7715 authorization to enable fully autonomous, multi-round on-chain gameplay.

### Requesting Advanced Permissions
Players grant a one-time, scoped permission via MetaMask to allow the agent to execute game actions on their behalf.  
This permission explicitly defines:

- Maximum ETH spend per round
- Maximum number of executable rounds
- Validity period
- Allowed contract calls (game start & execution)

**Code reference – Requesting Advanced Permissions:**
- https://github.com/andOneBasketball/Jackpet-Agent/blob/739494f240d2d0b40a1d85cd270179d991e5770d/frontend/src/hooks/useERC7715.ts#L530

This flow allows users to review and fine-tune permission limits directly in MetaMask before approving, ensuring transparency and informed consent.

### Redeeming (Using) Advanced Permissions

After approval, the autonomous agent redeems the granted ERC-7715 permission to automatically start and execute multiple game rounds without requiring repeated wallet confirmations.

All executions:
- Are strictly constrained by the originally approved permission scope
- Are fully enforced on-chain through contract-level checks
- Execute deterministically without any off-chain trust assumptions

**Code reference – Redeeming Advanced Permissions:**

Permission lifecycle management, including revocation or expiration, is handled by MetaMask as part of the Advanced Permissions framework, keeping user control at the wallet level while enabling seamless autonomous execution.

## ⭐ Social Media
We documented and shared the full development journey of Jackpet Agent on X, showcasing how **MetaMask Advanced Permissions** enabled autonomous gameplay, reduced repeated wallet prompts, and significantly improved the user experience.
