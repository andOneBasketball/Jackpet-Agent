During the MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off, Jackpet Agent has achieved a set of concrete, production-oriented milestones that highlight both technical depth and real-world feasibility for agentic on-chain applications:

1. During the MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off, **Jackpet Agent** demonstrates agentic on-chain gameplay where players grant a single **ERC-7715 permission** to an autonomous agent that automatically executes multiple game rounds—eliminating repeated wallet confirmations while enforcing per-round limits, multipliers, and reward rules on-chain.

2. All randomness is powered by **Chainlink VRF**, ensuring provably fair, auditable, and censorship-resistant outcomes, while a fully on-chain jackpot pool guarantees fund safety and trust minimization. The system has been deployed and tested on **Sepolia**, validating agent-based execution, reward settlement, and jackpot distribution under realistic conditions.

3. A functional frontend prototype allows players to authorize permissions, trigger autonomous gameplay, and view results and rewards through on-chain data. Jackpet Agent is chain-agnostic and designed to scale to any **EIP-7702–enabled network**, providing a blueprint for sustainable, fair, and community-driven autonomous gaming experiences.
