During the MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off, Jackpet Agent has achieved a set of concrete, production-oriented milestones that highlight both technical depth and real-world feasibility for agentic on-chain applications:

1. We designed and implemented the complete Jackpet Agent smart contract architecture, including an autonomous game engine, a flexible reward rule system, and a multiplier-based gameplay mechanism. All game logic is fully enforced on-chain, ensuring transparency, determinism, and secure execution under delegated permissions.

2. ERC-7715 permissions were integrated to allow players to grant a single authorization, enabling an autonomous agent to start and execute multiple game rounds on their behalf without repeated wallet confirmations—demonstrating a practical application of MetaMask Advanced Permissions.

3. Chainlink VRF provides provably fair, auditable, and censorship-resistant randomness for each game round. Every outcome can be independently verified on-chain, reinforcing fairness and trust in an agentic gameplay flow.

4. A secure jackpot pool mechanism has been fully implemented at the contract level. Funds are strictly governed by smart contract rules and cannot be withdrawn by any individual, including the project team, ensuring strong fund safety and trust minimization.

5. A functional frontend prototype connects directly to the deployed contracts, allowing players to grant permissions, trigger agentic gameplay, and view results and rewards through on-chain data, completing the full end-to-end autonomous user experience.

6. The system has been deployed and tested on Sepolia (as a reference network), validating agent-based execution, reward settlement, and jackpot distribution under realistic conditions.

7. Beyond the competition scope, we have established a clear roadmap for UI enhancements, expanded agentic gameplay mechanics, and eventual deployment on any EIP-7702–enabled network, aiming to incubate Jackpet Agent into a sustainable, fair, and community-driven autonomous on-chain gaming product.
