# Jackpet Agent Game Design

This document details the core gameplay mechanics and rule logic of **Jackpet Agent**, built to demonstrate **MetaMask Advanced Permissions** in a real-world agentic on-chain application.

While the project README provides a high-level overview of vision and goals, this document serves as the single source of truth for how **agentic gameplay executes autonomously on-chain**.

All gameplay outcomes, rewards, and jackpot distributions described here are fully enforced by smart contracts and executed by an autonomous agent under a **single ERC-7715 permission**, ensuring:

- Transparency and auditable execution  
- Fairness through provable randomness (Chainlink VRF)  
- Trust-minimized automated play without repeated wallet interactions  
- Chain-agnostic compatibility with any EIP-7702–enabled network
